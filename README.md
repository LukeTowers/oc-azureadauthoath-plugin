# Setup

1. Go to [`Azure Active Directory` -> `App registrations`](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredAppsPreview)
2. Create a new application (registration)
3. Choose a name (Example: "My OctoberCMS Application Sign-in Helper")
4. If asked, select the "Web app / API" Application Type
5. Provide the Redirect URI (by default will be `https://example.com/luketowers/azureadsso/login/microsoft/callback`, replace `https://example.com` with the URL to your OctoberCMS instance)
6. Click Register
7. Select your newly created application
8. Copy the "Application (client) ID" value and put it into your `.env` file for the `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID` env variable
9. Select the permissions required for your app in the "API Permissions" tab (recommended at least Microsft Graph -> `User.Read`, `email`, & `profile`)
10. Go to the Certificates & Secrets tab and create a new Client Secret (recommended to set it to "Never" expire). Copy this value down and use it for the `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET` env variable in your `.env` file.
11. This plugin can support more than one Azure Client. Adding the subdomain into the config/config.php to get the different config. The default config key is `packages`
